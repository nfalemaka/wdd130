            <h2>History</h2>
            <img src="images/history.jpeg" alt="A mountain goat in nature">
            <p>The company was established ten years ago when a father decided to create a small water rafting company for his children to enjoy. Today, that company has expanded and is now located in three locations in the valley to ensure everyone's safety and enjoyment while water rafting. This is a locally family owned business whose founder, Mr. George Louis, has now passed on his business to our current owner Mr. Henry Wallace, his grandson. Mr. Wallace believes in sharing everything his grandfather believed in when he started the company which is to help families and individuals have lasting, happy memories with those around them that not only will help them build stronger and better bonds but lasting memories for a lifetime.</p>
